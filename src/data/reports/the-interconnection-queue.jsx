      <h3>Speed to Power!</h3>
      <p>
        The line is currently up and to the right. We need to capitalize on this.
      </p>

      <h3>GPUs go BRRR</h3>
      <p>
        Not only do they go brr but they need a bunch of power and cost a whole bunch. It turns out
        that power is not that expensive relative to the nvidia tax.
      </p>

      <h3>Looking for Excess Transmission Capacity</h3>
      <p>
        Building new power lines is far too expensive. Lets just go where they already are.
      </p>

      <h3>What about generation?</h3>
      <p>
        Don't renewables also have this problem but opposite?
